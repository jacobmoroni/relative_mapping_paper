@article{Mangelson2018,
abstract = {— This paper reports on a method for robust se-lection of inter-map loop closures in multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Existing robust SLAM methods assume a good initialization or an " odometry back-bone " to classify inlier and outlier loop closures. In the multi-robot case, these assumptions do not always hold. This paper presents an algorithm called Pairwise Consistency Max-imization (PCM) that estimates the largest pairwise internally consistent set of measurements. Finding the largest pairwise internally consistent set can be transformed into an instance of the maximum clique problem from graph theory, and by leveraging the associated literature it can be solved in real-time. This paper evaluates how well PCM approximates the combinatorial gold standard using simulated data. It also evaluates the performance of PCM on synthetic and real-world data sets in comparison with DCS, SCGP, and RANSAC, and shows that PCM significantly outperforms these methods.},

abstract = {this work demonstrates the use of genetic algorithms in optimized view planning for 3d reconstruction applications using small unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs). the quality of uav site models is currently highly dependent on manual pilot operations or grid-based automation solutions. when applied to 3d structures, these approaches can result in gaps in the total coverage or inconsistency in final model resolution. genetic algorithms can effectively explore the search space to locate image positions that produce high quality models in terms of coverage and accuracy. a fitness function is defined, and optimization parameters are selected through semi-exhaustive search. a novel simulation environment for evaluating view plans is demonstrated using terrain generation software. the view planning algorithm is tested in two separate simulation cases: a water drainage structure and a reservoir levee, as representative samples of infrastructure monitoring. the optimized flight plan is compared against three alternate flight plans in each case. the optimized view plan is found to yield terrain models with up to 43{\%} greater accuracy than a standard grid flight pattern, while maintaining comparable coverage and completeness.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems as a data acquisition platform and as a measurement instrument are becoming attractive for many surveying applications in civil engineering. Their performance, however, is not well understood for these particular tasks. The scope of the presented work is the performance evaluation of a UAV system that was built to rapidly and autonomously acquire mobile three-dimensional (3D) mapping data. Details to the components of the UAV system (hardware and control software) are explained. A novel program for photogrammetric flight planning and its execution for the generation of 3D point clouds from digital mobile images is explained. A performance model for estimating the position error was developed and tested in several realistic construction environments. Test results are presented as they relate to large excavation and earth moving construction sites. The experiences with the developed UAV system are useful to researchers or practitioners in need for successfully adapting UAV technology for their application(s).},

@article{Labbe2013,
abstract = {In appearance-based localization and mapping, loop- closure detection is the process used to determinate if the cur- rent observation comes from a previously visited location or a new one. As the size of the internal map increases, so does the time required to compare new observations with all stored loca- tions, eventually limiting online processing. This paper presents an online loop-closure detection approach for large-scale and long- term operation. The approach is based on amemorymanagement method,which limits the number of locations used for loop-closure detection so that the computation time remains under real-time constraints. The idea consists of keeping the most recent and fre- quently observed locations in a working memory (WM) that is used for loop-closure detection, and transferring the others into a long-term memory (LTM). When a match is found between the current location and one stored in WM, associated locations that are stored in LTM can be updated and remembered for addi- tional loop-closure detections. Results demonstrate the approach's adaptability and scalability using ten standard datasets from other appearance-based loop-closure approaches, one custom dataset us- ing real images taken over a 2-km loop of our university campus, and one custom dataset (7 h) using virtual images from the racing video game “Need for Speed:MostWanted.”},

@techreport{Koch2017,
abstract = {This work presents a multiplicative extended Kalman filter for estimating the relative state of a multirotor vehicle operating in a GPS-denied environment. The filter fuses data from an inertial measurement unit and altimeter with relative-pose updates from a keyframe-based visual odometry or laser scan-matching algorithm. Because the global position and heading states of the vehicle are unobservable in the absence of global measurements such as GPS, the filter in this paper estimates the state with respect to a local frame that is colocated with the odometry keyframe. As a result, the odometry update provides nearly-direct measurements of the relative vehicle pose, making those states observable. The derivation in this paper is intended to provide a complete, self-contained presentation that is tutorial in nature and that clearly defines all quaternion conventions and properties used. This paper also contains several improvements and extensions to the filter, and includes several new useful properties relating to error quaternions and their Euler-angle decomposition. Finally, this paper derives the filter both for traditional dynamics defined with respect to an inertial frame, and for robocentric dynamics defined with respect to the vehicle's body frame, and provides insights into the subtle differences that arise between the two formulations.},

abstract = {This paper surveys recent results in coverage path planning, a new path planning approach that determines a path for a robot to pass over all points in its free space. Unlike conventional point-to-point path planning, coverage path planning enables applications such as robotic de-mining, snow removal, lawn mowing, car-body painting, machine milling, etc. This paper will focus on coverage path planning algorithms for mobile robots constrained to operate in the plane. These algorithms can be classified as either heuristic or complete. It is our conjecture that most complete algorithms use an exact cellular decomposition, either explicitly or implicitly, to achieve coverage. Therefore, this paper organizes the coverage algorithms into four categories: heuristic, approximate, partial-approximate and exact cellular decompo-sitions. The final section describes some provably complete multi-robot coverage algorithms.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for three-dimensional coverage path planning for autonomous structural inspection operations using aerial robots. The proposed approach is capable of computing short inspection paths via an alternating two-step optimization algorithm according to which at every iteration it attempts to find a new and improved set of viewpoints that together provide full coverage with decreased path cost. The algorithm supports the integration of multiple sensors with different fields of view, the limitations of which are respected. Both fixed-wing as well as rotorcraft aerial robot configurations are supported and their motion constraints are respected at all optimization steps, while the algorithm operates on both mesh-and occupancy map-based representations of the environment. To thoroughly evaluate this new path planning strategy, a set of B Kostas Alexis large-scale simulation scenarios was considered, followed by multiple real-life experimental test-cases using both vehicle configurations.},

@article{Sipahioglu2010,
abstract = {Multi-robot sensor-based coverage path planning requires every point given in the workspace has to be covered at least by a sensor of a robot in the robot team. In this study, a novel algorithm was proposed for the sensor-based coverage of narrow environments by considering energy capacities of the robots. For this purpose, the environment was modeled by a Generalized Voronoi diagram-based graph to guarantee complete sensor-based coverage. Then, depending on the required arc set, a complete coverage route was created by using the Chinese Postman Problem or the Rural Postman Problem, and this route was partitioned among robots by considering energy capacities. Route partitioning was realized by modifying the Ulusoy partitioning algorithm which has polynomial complexity. This modification handles two different energy consumptions of mobile robots during sensor-based coverage, which was not considered before. The developed algorithm was coded in C++ and implemented on P3-DX mobile robots both in laboratory and in MobileSim simulation environments. It was shown that the convenient routes for energy constrained multi-robots could be generated by using the proposed algorithm in less than 1 s.},

The latter is based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) which, consist of several steps to get the solutions. Each gene represents the robot position and some of chromosomes represent also the mini-path.
